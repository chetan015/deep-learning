This colab notebook implements several 3x3 kernels:
Horizontal Edge Detector
45 Degree Angle Detector
Blur Kernel
Sharpen Kernel
Identity function 


Channels and Kernels:
Kernels are feature extractors, which start with detecting simple features like edges.
Channels are similar feature bags. Each channel can be a layer, which extracts a particular type of feature
